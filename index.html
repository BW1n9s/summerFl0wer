                    <p>Hi there! I'm Zhongtian Wang.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently a student of information technology, and was a mechanical engineering student before.</p>

                    <h4>Q: What does ‘Design Computing’ mean to you?</h4>
                    <p>
                        It’s a process from thoughts to products. It’s like using methods to make a floating balloon get to the ground to carry things. 
                        And of course, there are some techniques to do with “Computing”, things like computer-assisted design.

                    <p>After the rapid design sprint process, our system concept is to design a mobile app based on the Brisbane public art database to 
                        encourage more people to visit and understand public art, so as to solve the problem of low awareness of public art.</p>

                    <p>It happened gradually with the iteration of the concept design.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently a student of information technology, and was a mechanical engineering student before.</p>
                    <p>However there was a deadly problem, which was pointed out during our user test that the project's MVP and highlight function are blurred by other features. 
                        For example, the sharing and 'diary-like' home page appear to be almost identical to several existing SNS applications (such as Instagram), 
                        undermining the main objective of increasing users' interest in public art and landmarks. As a result, we go over the MSCW foundation once more. 
                        After determining that the most important function of the system will be the user's collection process, 
                        we made significant modifications to better align the system with the concept and decided to cut all unrelated ones.

                        In most circumstances, the random construction of alternative databases and backdrops would have been paradoxical, 
                        but the procedure required me to apply my creativity and association, paving the road for the project's ultimate concept later on. 
                        The apparently unreasonable mix of context and database can sometimes surprisingly result in plausible and unique thoughts.

                    I pulled data from the Brisbane public art database API and used the leaflet map API to display the location of the public art on the map.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Since the system was significantly changed, and finally settled, there are more technical issues in this stage for me to conquer. 
                        First of all, the whole user interaction flow needs to be cleared. 
                        So I drew a flow diagram based on the discussions of our group meeting and finalized it with the suggestions and agreements of the rest of the group members. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="./imgs/flow.png" alt="flow diag">
                    <p>The diagram clearified the user interaction route and showed clearly about different information that needs to be displayed during different stages of collecting</p>

                    <h2>Interaction functions</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>There are several functions atomicly combined to form the whole interaction process. 
                        I started to build the functions one by one, and then combined them together to form the whole interaction process.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Data processing:</h4>
                    <p>The original API's raw data contains a lot of information that may be irrelevant and, in some situations, distracting to the databases’ usage in the project. 
                        For instance, the memorial database's description has numerous HTML tags, which appear as some unintelligible characters when shown in detail. 
                        Additionally, the public art API documents are too extensive thus generating too many classes for its useage purpose in this situation.
                        I wrote a function to format the text pulled from API and solve these problems:
                    </p>
                    <div class="sub">
                        <div class="left">
                            <img src="./imgs/format.png" alt="format">
                            <p>The function for formatting the description text and material text</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="right">
                            <img src="./imgs/format2.png" alt="format">
                            <p>Before formatting</p>
                            <img src="./imgs/format3.png" alt="format">
                            <p>Same data field after formatting</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Dynamic display:</h4>
                    <p>I created a local variable named "progress" to keep track of how many steps the user has taken. I also used it to update the necessary CSS element on the page and apply the dynamic effect.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./imgs/lvl.png" alt="">
                    <p>with code below</p>
                    <img src="./imgs/js3.png" alt="">
                    <p>Then in order to boost engagement and provide more positive feedback to users, the specifics of a specific item in the collection book will progressively be "unlocked" during the collecting process. And so on along the collection book's list.
                        Using Javascript, it is straightforward to keep track of each item and determine if it has been gathered, but it is more complex to portray the result on an HTML page. I attempted to include HTML class tags, but the issue continued. So, whenever it needs to be displayed, I just clear the container and update it. This final solution was not the most brilliant, but it served its goal admirably.

                    <p>In addition to introducing, and demonstrating, while using our website to interested visitors during the Tradeshow, 
                        my team and I also got to see projects from several other groups, not only the DECO7180 group. 
                        Many visitors to the show provided excellent remarks on our idea and work, which encouraged me a lot. I really had a lot of crops and fun during the trade show.

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>This week I attended the Tradeshow and explained to students and teachers who were interested in our product. Since our product is available, I also invited them to try our product. At the end of the trial, we generally received very good comments, which made me feel that all the efforts of the semester were worthwhile. Although the exhibition as a whole was a success, the two fake pages still make me feel hugely regretful. In the future, if I have such an opportunity, I will definitely make a more perfect and better finished product.

                    <h2>Semester summary</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Different from other DECO classes, 
                        this semester-long project focuses more on concept design and function realization than other stages such as user test and estimating. 
                        Throughout the entire design process, these two key variables should be refined while influencing one another. 
                        The primary function should be strongly related to the system concept, and the system concept should take into account the likelihood
                         and complexity of the main function's implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, the rapid design sprint inspires me a lot.
                         During a large project, it is essential for schedule management. 
                         And rapid design sprint can significantly shrink the trial process. 
                         It is a representation of a stepped procedure: first, determine the problem with precision; 
                         second, brainstorm with possible solutions; last, integrate and exclude these solutions and come up with a ‘best’ approach at this stage. 
                    </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, our project is still far from the ideal condition of the whole system concept we designed. 
                        It certainly fulfilled the main function and core of the concept, but there is still a lot to be upgraded in the future, 
                        such as adding a user register and login entrance to keep all data on the cloud instead of using browser cookies. 
                        And of course, adding pictures to each item.
